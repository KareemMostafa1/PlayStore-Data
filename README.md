# Google Play Store Data Cleaning, Pre-processing, and Visualization

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, preprocessing, and visualizing a real-world dataset of applications from the Google Play Store. The main objective is to transform raw, messy data into a structured and insightful format, enabling meaningful analysis and decision-making.

## 🧠 Goals

- Perform extensive **data cleaning** and handle inconsistencies.
- Apply **preprocessing techniques** to prepare the data for analysis.
- Use **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **visualization** to extract insights.
- Practice best practices using industry-standard libraries.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes of apps on the Google Play Store, including:

- App name  
- Category  
- Rating  
- Reviews  
- Installs  
- Size  
- Price  
- Type  
- Content Rating  
- and more...

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Scikit-learn** – Preprocessing utilities  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Loading the dataset**  
2. **Handling missing values and duplicates**  
3. **Converting data types** and standardizing formats (e.g., installs, size, price)  
4. **Encoding categorical variables**  
5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** through visualizations and statistics  
6. **Generating insights** and preparing the dataset for modeling or reporting

## 📌 Key Highlights

- Cleaned and standardized inconsistent entries in size, installs, and price fields.
- Handled missing values using imputation techniques and domain knowledge.
- Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends using bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
- Gained insights into most downloaded categories, app pricing trends, and content ratings.

## 📷 Example Visualizations

- App Category Distribution  
- Rating vs. Number of Reviews  
- Top 10 Most Installed App Categories  
- Price Distribution for Paid Apps
